    \subsection{Experiments with meshed networks}

        As announced in the abstract, in this report we are going to
        analyze and compare the behaviour of two different \emph{meshed
        networks} protocols, which are \batman\cite{bib:BATMAN} and
        \olsr\cite{bib:OLSR}.

        The data needed for the comparison has been obtained by running
        three different tests:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item   Measure the impact of a protocol on the performances of
                the network;
        \item   Observe how the transmission quality changes by adding
                different candidate routes to the network;
        \item   Measure the time needed to switch on an auxiliary route
                when when the primary one is no longer available.
        \end{itemize}

        Each test is described in detail respectively in
        Section~\ref{sec:Impact}, Section~\ref{sec:AddNode} and
        Section~\ref{sec:Convergence}.

    \subsection{The testbed}

        The testbed is composed by (...) equipped with (\$distro,
        \$kernel, \$specifiche) yadda yadda.
