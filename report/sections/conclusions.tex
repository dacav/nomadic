Our experiments gave us a positive opinion about both the analyzed
protocols. They are obviously able to make the mesh network work in a
sound way, but also without a perceptible impact on the transmission
quality, since the worsening of both latency and throughput are
negligible.

Of course, our considerations take care only of the technical aspects of
the context. It's clear that using a mesh network is not a pleasant
experience from the point of view of the user, who basically appreciates
smoothness. We saw, in fact, that the performance worsening is much more
bounded to the different topologies rather than the traffic related to the
protocol; the topology however is indirectly influenced by the protocol
data by means of the software.
