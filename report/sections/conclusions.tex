Our experiments gave us a positive opinion about both the analyzed
protocols. They are obviously able to make the mesh network work in a
sound way and also without a perceptible impact on the transmission
quality: the worsening of both latency and throughput are
negligible. That said however we weren't able to simulate a complex scenario
which would have emphatized their weakness: the number of nodes we
employed was just too small.

As a final remark, our impression was that \batman\ seems to be more
stable and overall shows more constant performances. This is probably
due to its simpler structure w.r.t. \olsr. However this consideration
may be influenced by the fact that our testbed is quite simple too. A
more complex configuration might work in favor of \olsr\ which is
designed to work on such topologies.
