    \subsection{Experiments with meshed networks}

        The comparison has been achieved by means of two different classes
        of tests: the first one aims to measure the worsening of the network
        performance due to the two protocols, the second one tests how
        responsive are the protocols with respect to changes in the
        network topology.
        
        The needed data has been retrieved by using some tools:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item   Data about latency has been obtained by means of the
                \emph{ping} tool;
        \item   Throughput has been measured with
                \emph{NetPerf}\cite{bib:NetPerf};
        \item   Statistics about protocol responsiveness for \batman\ and
                \olsr\ have been extrapolated by parsing the output of the
                two softwares respectively.
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{The testbed}

        The testbed has been composed by four laptops equipped with
        (\$distro, \$kernel, \$specifiche) yadda yadda. Basing on the
        different test, the topology has been arranged specifically, so
        far each of the following sections will be provided with a
        \emph{Topology} subsection describing it.
