        {Impact of the meshing protocols on the transmission latency. The
         three triples of boxplots show the latency performances of,
         respectively, \emph{direct link}, \emph{1-hop} and \emph{2-hops}
         topology. Each triple shows the performance with \emph{static
         routes} (first boxplot), \emph{\batman} (second boxplot) and
         \emph{\olsr} (third boxplot).}
