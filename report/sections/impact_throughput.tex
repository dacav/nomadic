\subsection{Test introduction}

    The throughput is probably the most relevant index of the network
    quality. In the context of \emph{mesh networking} a natural concern
    is how the overhead of the underlaying routing protocol affects it.

    \subsubsection{Expected results}

        \begin{itemize}
        \item   Small number of hosts;
        \item   Negligible variation of performances;
        \end{itemize}
